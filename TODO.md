## Muscle Volume Calculation and Data Pipeline Updates (2025-01-20)

### Issue
The muscle volume data was not being properly calculated and returned in the API response. The volume calculation should be:
- Primary muscles: 100% of total volume
- Secondary muscles: 50% of total volume
- Total volume = sets × reps × weight

Example for squats with total volume of 2,710 lbs:
- Quadriceps (PRIMARY, 40%): 2,710 × 0.40 = 1,084 lbs
- Glutes (PRIMARY, 30%): 2,710 × 0.30 = 813 lbs
- Hamstrings (SECONDARY, 15%): 2,710 × 0.15 = 406.5 lbs
- Calves (SECONDARY, 10%): 2,710 × 0.10 = 271 lbs
- Lower Back (TERTIARY, 5%): 2,710 × 0.05 = 135.5 lbs

### Changes Made
1. Updated `store_exercise_data` in `workout_storage_service.py` to calculate actual muscle volume based on:
   - Total workout volume from the exercise
   - Muscle activation percentages from Bedrock
   - Activation level (PRIMARY, SECONDARY, TERTIARY)

2. Fixed response handling in `chat.py` endpoint:
   - Removed ChatResponse model conversion which was causing null values
   - Now returning raw response with complete muscle data

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add unit tests for muscle volume calculations
- [ ] Add validation to ensure volume percentages sum to 100%
- [ ] Consider adding volume multipliers for different activation levels (e.g., PRIMARY = 1.0, SECONDARY = 0.5)
