## Debugging Notes (Updated 2025-01-18)

### Chat Integration Debugging - Resolved!
#### Fixed Issues
- âœ… Coroutine decode issue resolved by properly awaiting response body
- âœ… Streaming response handling updated to use non-streaming approach for better stability
- âœ… Response body handling updated to use `await response['body'].read()`

#### Current Work
- ðŸ”„ Fixed Claude 3.5 Haiku message format issues:
  - Kept message role as "assistant" (note: "system" role is not supported in Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Haiku)
  - Fixed response handling to properly extract text from content array
  - Made system prompt more prescriptive for structured workout analysis
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced error handling and validation:
  - Added better type checking for response objects
  - Improved error messages and logging
  - Added validation for response body and content

#### Next Steps
- ðŸ”² Test updated message format with various workout inputs
- ðŸ”² Monitor response structure and muscle data extraction
- ðŸ”² Consider adding unit tests for response handling
- ðŸ”² Add error recovery strategies for malformed responses

#### Issue: Chat Messages Not Appearing in Frontend

##### Investigation Steps (2025-01-18):

1. Initial Error: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'responseText')`
   - Fixed frontend event handling in `bedrock.ts`
   - Added buffer for partial responses
   - Improved error handling for JSON chunks
   - Enhanced logging for debugging

2. Second Error: Bedrock API Validation Exception
   - Error: "claude-3-5-haiku-20240022 is not supported on this API"
   - Updated model ID in settings.py to use correct format
   - Modified BedrockAgentService to use Messages API
   - Updated request body structure for streaming

3. Third Error: Prompt Format Validation
   - Error: "prompt must start with "H:" turn after an optional system prompt"
   - Fixed prompt formatting in BedrockAgentService
   - Added proper System/Human/Assistant markers
   - Updated message structure for Claude compatibility

4. Fourth Error: Double-Encoded Error Messages
   - Error appearing as stringified JSON in message field
   - Updated frontend to detect and parse double-encoded errors
   - Modified backend stream_response to prevent double-encoding
   - Added consistent error handling across all services

5. Fifth Error: Invalid Role in Messages API
   - Error: "system is not a valid enum value"
   - Changed system message role from "system" to "assistant"
   - Updated request body structure in stream_agent_response
   - Added more debug logging for request/response

6. Sixth Error: Coroutine Decode Issue
   - Error: "'coroutine' object has no attribute 'decode'"
   - Fixed response body handling in stream_agent_response
   - Using await response['body'].read() for proper async handling
   - Simplified non-streaming response handling
   - Removed streaming-related code for consistency
   - Enhanced error logging and validation
   - Updated integration_service for non-streaming approach

7. Seventh Error: Internal Server Error (500)
   - Error: "Request failed with status code 500"
   - Reverted back to non-streaming approach
   - Using invoke_model instead of invoke_model_with_response_stream
   - Simplified response handling
   - Added better error logging

##### Debugging Process:
1. **Error Analysis**:
   - Monitored backend logs using `docker-compose logs -f backend`
   - Checked browser console for error messages
   - Analyzed network requests in browser dev tools
   - Reviewed API documentation for correct message format

2. **Code Inspection**:
   - Reviewed error handling in frontend code
   - Checked message formatting in backend services
   - Verified API endpoint configurations
   - Inspected streaming response handling

3. **Iterative Fixes**:
   - Updated model ID and API format
   - Fixed message role validation
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Enhanced response formatting
   - Reverted to simpler non-streaming approach
   - Fixed coroutine handling

4. **Testing**:
   - Tested with various message inputs
   - Verified error handling behavior
   - Checked response format
   - Monitored logs for issues

##### Files Modified (Latest Updates):
1. Backend:
   - `/backend/app/services/bedrock_agent_service.py`:
     - Fixed response body handling
     - Using await response['body'].read() for proper async handling
     - Simplified non-streaming response handling
     - Removed streaming-related code for consistency
     - Enhanced error logging and validation
     - Updated integration_service for non-streaming approach

##### Current Status:
- Fixed coroutine handling in response
- Using non-streaming approach for stability
- Improved error handling and logging
- Monitoring for any remaining issues

##### Next Steps:
1. Test error handling with various edge cases
2. Add retry logic for failed requests
3. Implement better error handling in UI
4. Add unit tests for response handling
5. Monitor error logs for any remaining issues

##### Debugging Tips:
- Check browser's developer tools (Network tab) for request/response details
- Monitor backend logs: `docker-compose logs -f backend`
- Look for errors in browser console
- Verify network connectivity between services

##### Key Learnings:
1. **API Changes**: Claude 3.5 Haiku requires the Messages API format
2. **Error Handling**: Need consistent error format across all layers
3. **Message Format**: Role must be "assistant" or "user", not "system"
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging is crucial for debugging streaming issues
5. **Response Types**: Different response types require different handling (message, muscle_data, error)
6. **Simplicity**: Sometimes a simpler non-streaming approach is more reliable
7. **Validation**: Important to validate response format before processing
8. **Coroutines**: Must properly await coroutines before accessing their data

## Chat Integration Status (Updated 2025-01-18)

#### Current Working Implementation
- âœ… Using Claude 3.5 Haiku via Bedrock API
  - Model ID: `anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0`
  - Non-streaming implementation using `invoke_model`
  - Messages API format with `anthropic_version: "bedrock-2023-05-31"`

##### Message Format
```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "assistant",  // Note: 'system' role not supported in Bedrock
            "content": "<system_prompt>"
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "<user_message>"
        }
    ],
    "max_tokens": 2048,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "top_p": 0.9
}
```

##### Response Format
```json
{
    "content": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": "<response_text>"
        }
    ],
    "stop_reason": "end_turn",
    "usage": {
        "input_tokens": <number>,
        "output_tokens": <number>
    }
}
```

##### System Prompt Template
```markdown
You are a knowledgeable fitness assistant. You help analyze workouts and provide guidance.

For each workout, you must analyze and provide the following information in this exact format:

**Workout Summary**
- Exercise: [name]
- Sets: [number]
- Reps: [number]
- Weight: [number] lbs
- Total Volume: [calculation]

**Muscle Activation**
Primary Muscles:
- [muscle name] ([activation percentage]%)
- [muscle name] ([activation percentage]%)

Secondary Muscles:
- [muscle name] ([activation percentage]%)
- [muscle name] ([activation percentage]%)

**Analysis**
- Intensity level
- Training focus
- Form notes

**Recommendations**
- Progressive overload options
- Rest periods
```

#### Data Flow
1. Frontend (`bedrock.ts`) sends message to backend
2. Backend (`chat.py`) routes to `integration_service.py`
3. `integration_service.py` calls `bedrock_agent_service.py`
4. `bedrock_agent_service.py`:
   - Formats message with system prompt
   - Makes Bedrock API call
   - Extracts text from response
   - Attempts muscle data extraction
   - Yields message and muscle data as separate chunks
5. Frontend receives and displays chunks based on type

#### Fixed Issues
- âœ… Coroutine decode issue resolved by properly awaiting response body
- âœ… Streaming response handling updated to use non-streaming approach
- âœ… Response body handling updated to use `await response['body'].read()`
- âœ… Message format corrected to use "assistant" role instead of "system"
- âœ… Response parsing updated to handle Claude 3.5 Haiku content array format

#### Future Improvements
- ðŸ”² Add unit tests for response handling
- ðŸ”² Implement error recovery strategies
- ðŸ”² Add response validation against expected format
- ðŸ”² Consider adding conversation history support
- ðŸ”² Optimize muscle data extraction
