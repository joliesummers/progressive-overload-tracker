## Temporary Simplifications for User.py
## Things we Updated to User.Py to get authentication working

### Temporary Simplifications
1. Remove workout_sessions relationship for now
   - Remove from User model
   - Remove from UserInDB model
   - Remove WorkoutSession model entirely
   - Remove database tables for workout sessions

2. Simplify User model to bare essentials:
   - Keep only: id, email, full_name, is_active
   - Remove is_superuser and other optional fields
   - Remove all complex relationships

3. Simplify model configuration:
   - Use basic Pydantic v2 config
   - Remove detailed JSON schema examples
   - Keep only essential validation

### Plan to Add Back Later
1. Re-add workout_sessions with proper SQLAlchemy relationships
2. Add proper database migrations for the workout sessions table
3. Update the User model to include workout tracking
4. Add proper validation and examples back to models
5. Add proper error handling for workout session relationships

Note: These changes are temporary to get the authentication working and test the Claude integration. We will need to add these features back with proper testing and validation.

## Temporary Authentication Removal Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Authentication (Current)
1. Backend Changes:
   - [ ] Remove JWT token validation from endpoints
   - [ ] Remove user-specific data storage
   - [ ] Modify chat endpoint to work without authentication
   - [ ] Create temporary session-based storage for workout data
   - [ ] Update API responses to not require user context

2. Frontend Changes:
   - [ ] Remove login/registration pages
   - [ ] Remove token handling from API calls
   - [ ] Remove protected route wrappers
   - [ ] Update navigation to remove auth-dependent items
   - [ ] Store workout data in browser's localStorage

3. Data Model Simplification:
   - [ ] Remove User model and related tables
   - [ ] Modify WorkoutSession to work without user association
   - [ ] Create temporary data structures for session storage

### Phase 2: Re-implement Authentication (Future)
1. User Management:
   - [ ] Re-add User model with proper relationships
   - [ ] Implement proper database migrations
   - [ ] Add back authentication middleware
   - [ ] Implement proper password reset and email verification

2. Data Migration:
   - [ ] Create migration path for session data to user accounts
   - [ ] Add data import/export functionality
   - [ ] Implement data cleanup for old sessions

3. Frontend Updates:
   - [ ] Re-add authentication UI with improved UX
   - [ ] Implement proper token management
   - [ ] Add data persistence across sessions
   - [ ] Add multi-device sync support

Note: This is a temporary measure to allow faster development and testing of the core workout tracking and AI features. We will re-implement proper authentication once the core functionality is stable.
